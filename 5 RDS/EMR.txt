Amazon EMR is the industry - leading cloud big data platform for processing vast amounts of data usnig open-source tools such
Apache Spark, Apache Hive, Apache HBase, Apache Flink, Apache Hudi, etc
With EMR, You can run petabyte-scale analysis at less than half the cost of traditional on-premises solutions
and over three times faster than standard Apache Spark.

The Cental component of Amazon EMR is the cluster. A Cluster is a collection of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon Ec2) instance.
Each instance in the cluster is called a node. Each node has a role within the cluster, referred to as the node type.
Amazon EMR also installs different software components on each node type, giving each node a role in a distributed applciation like Apache Hadoop.

Master Node:
	A node that manages the cluster. The master node tracks the status of tasks and monitors the health of the cluster.
	Every cluster has a master node.
Core node:
	A node with software components that runs tasks ans stores data in hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) on your cluster.
	Multi-node cluster have atleast one core node
Task node:
	A node with software components that only runs tasks and does not store data in HDFS.
	Task nodes are optional
	
You can configure a cluster to periodically archive the log files stored on the master node to Amazon S3.
this ensures the logs files are available after the cluster terminates, whether this is through normal shutdown or due to error.
Amazon EMR archives the logs files to Amazon S3 at five-minute intervals
