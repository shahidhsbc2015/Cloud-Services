Example :- highly available architecture.

Scenario: You might have a website that requires a minimum of 6 instances and it must be highly available. You must also be able to tolerate the failure of 1 availability zone. What is the ideal architecture for this environment while being the most cost effective ?
2 Availability Zones with 2 instances in each AZ
3 Availability Zones with 3 instances in each AZ
1 Availability Zones with 6 instances in each AZ
3 Availability Zones with 2 instances in each AZ

Always be designing for failure
Use Multiple AZ's and Multiple regions wherever you can
Know the difference between Multi AZ and Read Replicas for RDS
Know the difference between scaling out and scaling up
 Scaling out is we use auto scaling groups and we add additional EC2 instances
 Scaling up is where we increase the resources inside our Ec2 instances i.e, go from a t2.micro to t6.xlarge
Read the questions carefully and always consider the cost element
Know the difference S3 storage classes
