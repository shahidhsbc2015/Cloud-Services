What is Lambda?
AWS lambda is a compute service where you can upload your code and create lambda functions
AWS lambda takes care of provisioning and managing the servers that you use to run the code.
You don't have to worry about operating systems patching scaling etc

Can use lambda in the following ways :
As an event-driven compute service where AWS lambda runs your code in response to events. These events could be changes to data in an Amazon S3 bucket or an Amazon dynamodb table
As a compute service to run your code in response to HTTP requests using Amazon's API gateway or API calls made using the AWS SDKs.

What languages does lambda support.

Node js
Java
Python 
C#
PowerShell


How lambda is priced 
---
Number of requests.
First 1 million requests are free. $0.20 per 1 million requests

Duration
----
Duration is calculated from the time your code begins executing until it return or otherwise terminated, rounded up the nearest 100ms.
The price depends on the amount of memory you allocated to your function. You are charged $0.00001667 fro evert GB/Second used

why is lambda ?

No servers!
No system administrators 
No patching operating system
No antivirus 
Continuously scales.
Super super cheap.

Exam tips.
---

Lambda scales out (not up) automatically 
Lambda functions are independent, 1 event = 1 function
Lambda is serverless

Lambda functions can trigger other lambda functions, 1 event can = X number of functions if functions
are triggering other functions.
Architectures can get extremely complicated, AWS X-ray service allows you to debug what is happening.
Lambda can do things globally, you can use it to back up S3 buckets to another S3 bucket 
know your triggers
