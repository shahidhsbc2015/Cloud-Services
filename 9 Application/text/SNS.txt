Amazon SNS or Simple Notification Service is a web service that makes it easy to setup, operate and send notifications from the cloud.

It provides developers with a highly scalable, flexible and cost effective capability to publish messages from an application and immediately deliver them to subscribers or to other applications.

Push notifications you can do these to Apple, Google, Fire OS and Windows devices as well as Android devices.

Besides pushing a cloud notifications directly to mobile devices SNS can also deliver notifications by SMS text messages or email to Amazon SQS or to any HTTP endpoints.

SNS allows you to group multiple recipients using topics. A topic is basically an access point for dynamically subscribe for identical copies of the same notification.
One topic can support deliveries to multiple endpoint types for example you can group together iOS, Android and SMS recipients.
When you publish once to a topic SNS delivers appropriately formatted copies of your message to each subscriber 
To prevent messages from being lost all messages published to SNS are stored redundantly across multiple Availability Zones.
