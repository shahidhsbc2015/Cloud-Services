Simple workflow service is web service that makes it easy to coordinate work across distributed application components.It's a way of coordinating work across a whole bunch of different components within your application
SWf enables applications for a range of use cases including media media processing, web application back-ends, business process workflows and analytic pipelines to be designed as a coordination of tasks

Tasks represents invocation of various processing steps in an application which can be performed by executable code, web service calls, human interactions/action and scripts.

SWF and SQS
SQS has a retention period of 14 days and with SWF the workflow executions can last up to 1 year.
Amazon SWF presents a task orientated API whereas Amazon SQS offers a message orientated API 
SWF ensures that a task is assigned only once and is never duplicated. With SQS you need to handle duplicated messages and may also need to ensure that a message is processed only once 
SWF keeps track of all the tasks and events in an application. With SQS, you need to implement your own application level tracking, especially if your applications use multiple queues.
